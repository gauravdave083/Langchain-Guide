# Langchain-Guide
LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that rely on large language models (LLMs). It allows developers to integrate LLMs with a variety of tools, environments, and data sources. Below is a summary of key concepts and typical code structure when using LangChain:

### Key Concepts:
<br/>
1\. **Chains**: Chains in LangChain refer to a series of steps or actions where each step can involve running a model or performing an operation (e.g., retrieving information, processing data). Chains can be simple or complex, with multiple sub-chains combined.

2\. **Agents**: Agents are used to make decisions within the chain. They can select which tool to use at each step or decide the next action based on the current context. Agents are especially useful in scenarios where dynamic decision-making is required.

3\. **Memory**: LangChain supports memory modules that allow the model to retain information across interactions. This is useful for creating applications where context must be remembered over multiple interactions.

4\. **Tools**: Tools in LangChain refer to external services or functions that the chain can interact with. This could include APIs, databases, or other external systems. Tools are integrated into the chain and can be invoked as needed.

5\. **Prompts**: Prompts are central to LangChain's functionality. They define how information is presented to the LLM and how responses are structured. LangChain provides utilities for prompt engineering to optimize interactions with the model.

### Basic Code Structure:
<br/>
```python

from langchain import LangChain, OpenAI, LLMChain, SimplePromptTemplate, Chain

# Step 1: Define your model (e.g., OpenAI's model)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)

# Step 2: Create a prompt template

prompt_template = SimplePromptTemplate(template="Translate the following text to French: {text}")

# Step 3: Define a chain

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt_template=prompt_template)

# Step 4: Execute the chain

result = chain.run({"text": "Hello, how are you?"})

print(result)

# Optional: Combining chains

combined_chain = Chain([chain, another_chain])

combined_result = combined_chain.run(input_data)

```

### Advanced Features:
<br/>
- **Custom Chains**: You can create custom chains by combining multiple LLM chains, adding conditional logic, or incorporating other operations like API calls.

- **Agents and Toolkits**: For more complex use cases, you can use agents that dynamically select which tools to use based on the input and context.

- **Memory**: Integrating memory allows for contextual continuity across multiple interactions, which is crucial for applications like chatbots.
<br/>
LangChain is modular, so you can add or remove components based on your needs, making it a flexible solution for various LLM-based applications.
